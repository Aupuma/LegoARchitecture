  description: "Opened in 2000 to mark the new millennium, the London Eye is still
    the world\u2019s largest cantilevered observation wheel. With a height of 443
    ft. (135 m), this remarkable feat of design and engineering has become the UK\u2019s
    most popular paid attraction, with 3.75 million visitors every year. On a clear
    day it is possible to see up to 25 miles (40.2 km) in the distance from the top
    of the wheel.\r\n\r\nOriginally intended as a temporary structure, the London
    Eye is now a permanent fixture of the London skyline and an iconic symbol of modern
    London.\r"
