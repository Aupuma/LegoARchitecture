    grown to become the cultural and economic capital of Britain and one of the world\u2019s
    truly global cities.\r\n\r\nFamous for its finance, fashion and arts industries,
    London is the world\u2019s most visited city and also one of its most culturally
    diverse; more than 300 languages are spoken by its population of over 8.5 million
    people.\r\n\r\nStanding on the River Thames, London\u2019s skyline reflects both
    the city\u2019s diverse and colorful past and its continued ambition to embrace
