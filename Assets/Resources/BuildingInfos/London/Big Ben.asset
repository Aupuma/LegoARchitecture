  description: "Big Ben (the Great Bell), officially known as the Elizabeth Tower
    (formerly known as the Clock Tower and renamed in 2012 in honor of Queen Elizabeth\u2019s
    Diamond Jubilee), has stood at the northeastern corner of the Palace of Westminster
    for over 150 years. \r\n\r\nThe 316 ft. (96.3 m) neo-gothic styled tower is one
    of the most recognized and photographed landmarks in London today and an integral
    part of the city\u2019s skyline. The tower\u2019s clock mechanism is wound by
    hand three times a week and is still as accurate today as when it was constructed
    over 150 years ago.\r"
