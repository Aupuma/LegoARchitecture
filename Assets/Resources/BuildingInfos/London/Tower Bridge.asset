  description: "It took eight years and 11,000 tons of steel to construct the 213
    ft. (65 m) tall Tower Bridge, and when it opened in June 1894 it was regarded
    as the most sophisticated bridge of its type in the world. \r\n\r\nThe framework
    was clad in Cornish granite and Portland stone to protect the underlying steelwork,
    and to give the Bridge a more pleasing appearance.\r\n\r\nBuilt with giant movable
    roadways that lift up for passing ships, it is still considered an engineering
    marvel and arguably remains the most recognized bridge in the world.\r"
