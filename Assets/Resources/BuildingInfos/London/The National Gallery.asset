  description: "From the very start, the aim of the National Gallery was to ensure
    that the widest public possible could enjoy its collection. When Parliament agreed
    to pay for the construction of a new gallery in 1831, there were lengthy discussions
    about where the building should be located. Trafalgar Square was eventually chosen,
    as it was considered to be at the very center of the city and therefore accessible
    by all classes of London society.\r\n\r\nConstruction began in 1832 and the new
    gallery was finally completed in 1838. The building has been enlarged and altered
    many times as the National Gallery\u2019s collection grew and today holds over
    2,300 works of art. \r\n\r\nOver six million people visit the Gallery every year
    to enjoy works by Leonardo da Vinci, Vincent\r Van Gogh and J.M.W. Turner.\r"
