  description: "Painted Ladies refers to the San Franciscan architectural phenomenon
    of brightly painted Victorian or Edwardian houses, acquiring its name from a 1978
    photo essay by writers Elizabeth Pomada and Michael Larsen. \r\n\r\nThe transformation
    of these formerly sober-colored houses into cheerful and colorful buildings is
    believed to have been led by a local artist who painted his own Victorian house
    in vivid blues and greens in the 1960s, starting what was known as the \u2018colorist
    movement\u2019, which continues to this day. In parts of the city, San Francisco\u2019s
    Painted Ladies stand in stark contrast to the skyscrapers of the downtown area.\r"
