  description: "Located in the center of San Francisco\u2019s financial district,
    this iconic skyscraper is the fourth tallest building in the city and the largest
    by floor area. Until the merger in 1998 with NationsBank, it was the headquarters
    of the Bank of America and was intended as a display of prosperity, power and
    importance. Wurster, Bernardi and Emmons and Skidmore, Owings and Merrill designed
    the carnelian-clad building, in consultation with architect Pietro Belluschi.\r"
