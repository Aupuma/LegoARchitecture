  description: "The Golden Gate Bridge is one of the best-known and most beautiful
    bridges in the world and one of the emblems of San Francisco. With its iconic
    color, spectacular location and graceful lines, this suspension bridge is a design
    and engineering marvel and the city\u2019s most popular tourist attraction.\n\nDesigned
    by Irving Morrow, Charles Alton Ellis and Joseph Strauss, the bridge was created
    to make travel between San Francisco and Marin County easier; but due to differing
    interests among the stakeholders, it was over a decade before it got the green
    light. \n\nConstruction took four years and it was finally opened in 1937 during
    a week of official celebrations.\r\n"
