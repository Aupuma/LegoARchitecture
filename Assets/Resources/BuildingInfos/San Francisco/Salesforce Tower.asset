  description: "Located downtown in the \u2018SoMa\u2019 district of the city, the
    Salesforce Tower is the tallest building in the San Francisco skyline. Designed
    by Cesar Pelli and opened in 2018, the soaring 1,070 ft. (326m) tall, 61-story
    tower has an elegant, obelisk shape with horizontal metal fins that act as sunshades.
    \n\nThe building has been created with an emphasis on sustainable design, including
    a water recycling system and high efficiency air ventilation. The sunshades on
    the outside maximize light but reduce solar gain, while heat-exchanging coils
    in the foundation utilize the earth\u2019s constant cooler temperature to aid
    cooling of the building.\r"
