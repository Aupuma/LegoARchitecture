  description: "The Lillian Coit Memorial Tower is a memorial tower located in Pioneer
    Park in the Telegraph Hill neighborhood of San Francisco. This art deco monument
    was designed by architects Arthur Brown Jr and Henry Howard and dedicated in 1933.
    \n\nThe tower was built to commemorate Lillian Hitchcock Coit, who was a local
    character and a champion and benefactor of firefighters. Her bequest to the city
    of San Francisco also sponsored the creation of a statue of three firefighters
    in Washington Square Park.\r"
