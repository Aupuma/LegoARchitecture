  description: "At 48 stories, the Transamerica Pyramid is the second tallest building
    in the San Francisco skyline and is one of the symbols of the city. \n\nCommissioned
    by The Transamerica Corporation, the striking, angular building was designed by
    architect William Pereira, and built by Hathaway Dinwiddie, with construction
    being completed in 1972. During the seasonal holidays and for special occasions,
    a bright beacon known as the \u2018Crown Jewel\u2019 lights up the pyramid\u2019s
    peak.\r\n"
