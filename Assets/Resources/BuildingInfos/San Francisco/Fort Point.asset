  description: "The masonry seacoast fortification, Fort Point, dates all the way
    back to the American Civil War when it was built by the United States Army to
    defend San Francisco against hostile warships. Now protected as the Fort Point
    National Historic Site, the fortification never saw hostilities during the Civil
    War and over the subsequent years was used for military barracks, training and
    storage.\r"
