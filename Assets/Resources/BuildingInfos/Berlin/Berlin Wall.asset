  nameIdentifier: The Berlin Wall
  description: "The Wall was both a physical barrier between West Berlin and East
    Germany, and the symbolic boundary between western democracy and Communism during
    the Cold War. Started in August 1961, the wall was 96 miles (155 km) long and
    had a height of 11.8 ft. (3.6 m) in the section that divided the city.\r\n\r\nLittle
    remains of the Berlin Wall within the city itself. A double row of cobblestones
    traces its 3.5 mile (5.5 km) route through the city center, while the Berlin Wall
    Memorial on Bernauer Strasse includes a preserved 197 ft. (60 m) strip of \u201Cno
    man\u2019s land\u201D where the wall once divided the city.\r"
