  description: "The Brandenburg Gate (Brandenburger Tor) is one of Berlin\u2019smost
    important architectural structures and a historical  symbol all in one. The gate
    has been at the heart of German and European history for over 200 years. \r\n\r\nCommissioned
    by King Frederick William II of Prussia, it was built as the grandest of a series
    of 18 city gates through which Berlin was once entered. Designed by architect
    Carl Gotthard Langhans and constructed between 1788 and 1791, the inspiration
    for the gate came from the entry hall of the Acropolis in Athens, Greece. \r\n\r\nThe
    gate itself is built in sandstone  and consists of twelve Doric columns, six to
    each side, forming five separate passageways. Atop the gate is the Quadriga\u2014a
    chariot drawn by four horses driven by Victoria, the Roman goddess of victory.\r"
