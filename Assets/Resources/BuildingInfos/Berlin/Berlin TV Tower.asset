  description: "If you want to enjoy a spectacular 360\xB0 view of Berlin\u2019s skyline
    then take a trip up the 1,207 ft. (368 m) tall Berlin TV Tower (Fernsehturm Berlin).
    The visibility from the rotating visitor platform in the middle of the tower\u2019s
    sphere can reach 26 miles (42 km) on a clear day.\r\n\r\nThe tower consists of
    an 820 ft. (250 m) concrete shaft upon which sits a seven-story sphere, crowned
    by a 387 ft. (118 m) red and white striped antenna mast. \r\n\r\nConstructed between
    1965 and 1969, the decision to place the tower in the center of the city was as
    much political as technical. The East German regime needed a powerful transmitter
    to counter the growing influence of Western TV and chose to make a bold statement
    with a futuristic tower that would dominate the Berlin skyline. \r\n\r\nThe first
    conceptual sketches of the tower were drawn by Hermann Henselmann. He was also
    the architect who had been given the task of modernizing the East German section
    of the city. He saw straight away the potential for the tower to become an iconic
    centerpiece of his urban renewal project as well as a symbol of the technological
    prowess of the socialist state. \r\n\r\nThe Berlin TV Tower remains Germany\u2019s
    tallest structure and a popular destination for almost 1.2 million visitors every
    year.\r"
