  description: "If there is a building in Berlin that symbolizes both the city\u2019s
    turbulent history and modern resurgence then it is the Reichstag (Reichstagsgeb\xE4ude).
    Completed in 1894 after ten years of construction, the parliament building witnessed
    the birth of German democracy, the rise of National Socialism and the decay of
    the Cold War period. \r\n\r\nSeverely damaged by a fire in 1933 and almost completely
    destroyed during World War II, the building was partially rebuilt during the 1960s,
    but remained largely unused.\r\n\r\n It was only with the reunification of East
    and West Germany and the restoration of Berlin as the country\u2019s capital that
    a complete renovation of the building took place. The renowned English architect
    Sir Norman Foster combined the original historical fa\xE7ade with modern architectural
    elements such as the spectacular glass dome to create a modern seat of democracy
    for the German Bundestag (parliament)."
