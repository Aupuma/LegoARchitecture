  description: "Located on Potsdamer Platz in the heart of the city, this mpressive
    office block is part of the Sony Center complex, the odernist symbol of the regeneration
    of Berlin since Geman reunification in 1990. \r\n\r\nWith Berlin badly damaged
    during World War II and divided by the Berlin Wall for almost 30 years, authorities
    were determined that the regeneration of Potsdamer Platz would re-establish itas
    a dynamic, modern city. When Sony decided to erect its new European headquarters
    in the square, the company employed the renowned architect Helmut Jahn who designed
    an eyecatching 338 ft. (103 m) semi-circular glass and steel tower.\r\n\r\nOpened
    in June 2000, the office is now home to Deutsche Bahn AG, the German national
    railway company, and is referred to as BahnTower. The building is the tallest
    structure on Potsdamer Platz.\r"
