  description: "Two granite columns stand guard at the entrance to St. Mark\u2019s
    Square (Piazza di San Marco).\r\n\r\nOn top of the western column is a statue
    of St. Theodore, the first patron of the city. Here he holds a spear and his foot
    rests upon a crocodile\u2014representing the dragon he was said to have slain.
    On the eastern column stands the winged Lion of Venice, the symbol of the second
    patron of the city, St. Mark.\r\n\r\nBoth columns are believed to have been erected
    in about 1268 and it is believed that the city executed convicted criminals between
    the two columns in days gone by. To this day, superstitious Venetians avoid walking
    between this pair of columns.\n"
