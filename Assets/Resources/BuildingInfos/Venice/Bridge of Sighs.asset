  description: "Bridge of Sighs (Ponte dei Sospiri) is an enclosed bridge constructed
    in white limestone that passes over the Rio di Palazzo, connecting the old city
    prison to the interrogation rooms in the Doge\u2019s Palace. Designed by Antonio
    Contino, the nephew of Antonio da Ponte who created the Rialto Bridge, the bridge
    was completed in 1602.\r\n\r\nThe bridge\u2019s romantic name is thought to refer
    to the sighs ofconvicts as they saw their last view of Venice before being taken
    to their prison cells. In reality, very little of the city could be seen through
    the stone grills covering the windows and the majority of prisoners at that time
    were small-time criminals.\r\n"
