  description: "As one of the tallest structures in the city, St. Mark\u2019s Campanile
    (Campanile di San Marco) is one of Venice\u2019s most recognizable symbols. From
    here the visitor has an incredible view of the city and lagoon as well as the
    Italian Alps in the distance.\r\n\r\nThe 323 ft. (98.6 m) bell tower stands alone
    in the corner of St. Mark\u2019s Square, near the front entrance to the basilica.
    The brick structure is 39 ft. (12 m) wide on each side and 160 ft. (50 m) tall,
    upon which sits a belfry housing five bells. A spire caps the tower with a golden
    weather vane on top.\r\n\r\nThough the design of the Campanile is from the 16th
    century, the tower itself was completely rebuilt in 1912 after the original one
    collapsed in 1902. The inauguration of the new tower occurred exactly 1000 years
    after the foundation of the original tower was laid.\r\n"
