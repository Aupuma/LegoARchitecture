  description: "The Rialto Bridge (Ponte di Rialto) spans the Grand Canal at the heart
    of the historic city. Built between 1588 and 1591, it replaced earlier wooden
    bridges that had linked the districts of San Marco and San Polo since the 12th
    century.\r\n\r\nWhen the last wooden bridge collapsed in 1524, several projects
    were considered before the city authorities requested plans for a stone bridge
    in 1551. The architect Antonio da Ponte competed with illustrious competitors
    such as Michelangelo and Palladio before winning the contract.\r\n\r\nHis single
    span design with a 24 ft. (7.5 m) arch included three walkways: two along the
    outer edges and a wider central walkway between two rows of small shops. The entire
    structure was built on some 12,000 wooden pilings that still support the bridge
    over 400 years later.\r\n"
