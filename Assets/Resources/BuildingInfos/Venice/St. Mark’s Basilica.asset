  description: "St. Mark\u2019s Basilica (Basilica di San Marco) is the most famous
    church in Venice and the best-known example of the city\u2019s unique Italo-Byzantine
    architecture.\r\n\r\nBuilt to house the relics of Mark the Evangelist, little
    is known about the original church buildings, but the current structure is thought
    to have been constructed between 1073 and 1093. The basilica is laid out in the
    design of a Greek cross and the tallest of the five domes reach 141 ft. (43 m)
    in height.\r\n\r\nWhile the layout of the church has remained constant over the
    centuries, the decoration on the inside and outside of the church has changed
    greatly. Venice\u2019s involvement in crusades and conquests saw mosaics, columns,
    and friezes from all over the Mediterranean added to the original opulent, golden
    mosaic\r\ninterior. Outside, the exterior brickwork was gradually covered with
    marble cladding and carvings as Venetian vessels returned with the spoils of war
    and trade.\r\n\r\nA symbol of the wealth and power of the Venetian Republic, St.
    Mark\u2019s Basilica remains one of the city\u2019s most impressive landmarks
    today.\r\n"
