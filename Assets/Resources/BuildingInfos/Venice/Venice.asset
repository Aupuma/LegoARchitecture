  description: "Built on over 100 islands in a marshy lagoon at the edge of the Adriatic
    Sea, Venice has a skyline that rises from the water to create a unique architectural
    experience. There are no roadways or cars in the historic city; instead 177 canals
    crossed by over 400 bridges give access to innumerable narrow, mazelike alleys
    and squares.\r\n\r\nWhile the origin of the city dates back over 1500 years, the
    golden age of Venice occurred during the late Middle Ages and Renaissance periods
    when it became one of the most powerful republics in the eastern Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nToday
    the city is facing major challenges including gradual subsidence, flooding, and
    problems caused by its popularity as a tourist destination. More than 60,000 people
    visit Venice each day\u2014more than the population of the city itself\u2014putting
    pressure on the city to accommodate these guests while maintaining its unique
    nature and identity.\r"
